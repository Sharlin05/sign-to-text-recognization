# sign-to-text-recognizationThe
Sign-to-Text Recognition System is an AI-based project that translates hand gestures from sign language into readable text. It uses a combination of computer vision and machine learning to detect, analyze, and recognize hand signs captured through a camera. The output text appears on the screen, allowing smooth communication between speech-impaired individuals and others who may not understand sign language.

Objective of the Project
The main goal of this project is to bridge the communication gap between the deaf and hearing communities. By converting gestures into text, it provides an easy and accessible way for users to express themselves digitally or in real time. This system can later be expanded to include speech output, making it even more interactive.

Technologies and Libraries Used
The project is mainly developed in Python, a powerful language for AI and computer vision applications.

The key libraries used include:
OpenCV – for capturing video frames and image processing.
MediaPipe – for accurate hand and finger landmark detection.
NumPy and Pandas – for handling and managing numerical and dataset operations.
TensorFlow / Keras – for building, training, and deploying the machine learning model.
scikit-learn – for preprocessing and encoding class labels.
Matplotlib – for visualizing model performance and training results.

Project Workflow
1. Data Collection
In this project, the dataset is collected from Kaggle, which contains images of different hand gestures representing alphabets and numbers. Using a pre-collected dataset helps to save time and ensures that the model is trained with a large variety of signs.

2. Data Preprocessing
The collected images are preprocessed before training. Each image is resized, normalized, and converted into a suitable format for the model. This step helps to remove noise and improve the accuracy of predictions.

3. Model Training (Using CNN Algorithm)
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm is used to train the model. CNN is a powerful deep learning technique that learns important features from the gesture images and identifies the pattern of each sign. The model is trained using the Kaggle dataset until it can correctly recognize different signs.

5. Real-Time Detection
After training, the model is connected to a web camera to recognize signs in real time. When a user shows a hand gesture, the system captures it through the webcam and uses the trained CNN model to detect which sign it represents.

5. Display Output
Finally, the recognized sign is displayed as a letter or word on the screen. This allows smooth and instant translation of sign language into readable text, making communication easier and more accessible.
